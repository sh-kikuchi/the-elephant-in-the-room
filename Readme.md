## The Elephant in the Room

### 1. Overview

- 'the Elephant in the room' is my private PHP flame work.

### 2. Project Code is "Gladiolus"

- This project code is named Gladiolus. The gladiolus flower symbolizes strength, integrity, and victory, reflecting the essence of this PHP framework. Just as the gladiolus stands tall and resilient, this framework aims to empower developers with robust and reliable tools to build outstanding web applications. 

### 3. Set up

#### Clone Projectes & Install Packages
- Let's start by cloning the project.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sh-kikuchi/the-elephant-in-the-room.git
    ```

- After that, let's run `composer install`.
    ```
    composer install
    ```

#### Connect Database
- Prepare a `.env` file in the project directory and configure it as follows:
  ```env
    DB_HOST = 'localhost'
    DB_NAME = 'test'
    DB_USER = 'root'
    DB_PASS = ''
    PASSWORD = 'password'
  ```

- To create the table, please run the following command:
    ```
    ã€€php elephant migrate
    ```

- To insert data into the table, please run the following command:
    ```php
    ã€€php elephant seed     
    ```

### 4. Architecture
#### 3-tier architecture
- This framework is based on a 3-tier architecture, consisting of three layers: Model, Service, and View.
  - **Model**: Handles database operations and business logic.
    - *Entity*: Represents database tables as classes.
    - *Repository*: Encapsulates the actual logic for database operations, handling CRUD operations for Entities.
  
  - **Service**: Processes business logic and acts as an intermediary between Model and View.
  
  - **View**: Manages the user interface presented to the user.

This design improves code readability and maintainability, allowing each layer to be developed, tested, and modified independently.
Moreover,By providing interfaces for models and services, you can write type-safe and clean code.
